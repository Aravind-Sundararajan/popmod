This is a really simple lifestage model of turtle population dynamics that I presented at conference.

There are Eggs, Children, and Adults, the flux of each of these are governed by leslie matrices on a simple square grid.

Ideally, this model should be formulated as an FEM problem with the nodal network defined by some geospatial imagery of a local coast, 
but this is a simple example to show a spatio-temporal model.
